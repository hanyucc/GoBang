# Gobang
Gobang is also called "Five in a Row" or "Gomoku".  
  
The first player to get an unbroken row of five pieces wins the game. It can be either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  
  
This project is created using Unity and C#. An AI, which always uses the white pieces, is included.  
  
It is the only game mode available currently.
