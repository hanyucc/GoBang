# Gobang
Gobang is also called "Five in a Row" or "Gomoku".  
The first player to get an unbroken row of five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.  
  
This game is created using Unity and C#.  
An AI, which always uses the white pieces, is included. And it is also the only game mode available currently.
